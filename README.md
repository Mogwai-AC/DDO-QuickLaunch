# DDO-QuickLaunch
The faster, easier way to log in to Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO)

# How it works
DDO-QuickLaunch skips a bunch of steps that the normal launcher does:
* Downloading News

* Patching
* EULAs

Things DDO-QuickLaunch does not skip:

* Waiting for the Login Queue, if there is one.

# How do you store passwords?
DDO-QuickLaunch uses the Microsoft Data Protection API built into Windows to secure your passwords.  You can read more about it here:
